# NOMMY
NOMMY, also known as MealsToGo, was an app I created while following Zero to Mastery's React Native course.

Through this project, I have familiarised myself with the concepts of:
1. react native basics
2. expo fonts, icons
3. async storage
4. react navigation
5. eslint / prettier
6. styled components
7. firebase
8. context

Throughout the course, I actively thought about the steps I was doing (as if I were creating my own app), rather than just passively following throughout, and there are some feature differences between this app and the tutorial.

The original vision was to build on the app created by the tutorial into my own app with different functions, but as time went on I realised that there wasn't as much of a need for the app, since its core functionality ran on Google's Places API, which already exists


Nonetheless, wonderful tutorial and I am confident of building apps now.
